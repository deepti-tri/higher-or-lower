The application prompts the user for a maximum number.
The application validates the user input and does not allow invalid entries (negative numbers, 0, or non-numbers), re-prompting the user if an invalid entry is provided.
If the user provides a decimal number, the application rounds it.
The application selects a random number between 1 and N (where N is the user-provided maximum number).

The user will enter a guess into a text input and click a button to submit the guess.

When submitted, one of the following messages should be displayed:

"Great guess!" if the guess is right.
"No, you guessed too low. Try a higher number!" if the guess is too low.
"No, you guessed too high. Try a lower number!" if the guess is too high.
